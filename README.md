## Technical Description

### Technologies Used

**1. Unity with C#:**
   - **Engine:** The core of our game is developed using Unity, a powerful game development platform that enables us to create immersive 3D environments and interactive gameplay.
   - **Programming Language:** The primary scripting language used is C#. C# is integrated within Unity to handle game logic, character movements, interactions, and other gameplay elements.

**2. GPT-4 API:**
   - **Quiz Question Generation:** For the quiz challenges in Level 1, we utilize the GPT-4 API to dynamically generate quiz questions. This ensures a variety of questions and an engaging experience for the players.
   - **Integration:** The GPT-4 API is accessed using Python scripts. These scripts are responsible for making API calls, retrieving quiz questions, and sending them to the Unity game.

### Additional Tools and Frameworks

- **Visual Studio:** Used as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for coding and debugging the C# scripts within Unity.
- **Unity Asset Store:** Various assets such as models, textures, and sounds are sourced from the Unity Asset Store to enhance the visual and auditory experience of the game.
- **JSON:** Utilized for data interchange, especially in handling the quiz questions and responses generated by the GPT-4 API.

### Key Components

- **Game Scenes:** The game is structured into different scenes corresponding to each level. Each scene contains the unique elements and logic required for that level.
- **UI Elements:** Unity's UI system is employed to create interactive menus, dialogues, and HUD (heads-up display) elements that guide the player through the game.
- **AI and Pathfinding:** Custom AI scripts manage the behavior of the monster in Level 2, including pathfinding and player tracking.
- **Collision Detection:** Implemented using Unity's physics engine to handle interactions with traps, firewalls, and other environmental hazards.

### Integration Process

**API Integration:**
   - **Python Backend:** Python scripts are used to interact with the GPT-4 API. These scripts handle the API requests and responses, which include fetching quiz questions from GPT-4.
   - **Communication with Unity:** The Python backend communicates with the Unity game via HTTP requests or sockets. The retrieved quiz questions are sent to Unity, where they are displayed to the player.
   - **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to manage API response issues or connectivity problems, ensuring a seamless player experience.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization:** When the player reaches the quiz section, Unity triggers a request to the Python backend.
2. **API Request:** The Python script makes a call to the GPT-4 API, requesting a new quiz question.
3. **Data Processing:** The GPT-4 API generates a quiz question and sends it back to the Python script.
4. **Response Handling:** The Python script processes the API response and formats it as needed.
5. **Unity Integration:** The formatted quiz question is sent to Unity, where it is presented to the player.

By leveraging these technologies and tools, we have created a dynamic and engaging escape room game that challenges players with diverse puzzles and interactive gameplay.
